                THE Department of Education (DepEd) reminded students 
                and school personnel to continue observing prevailing health 
                measures to prevent a surge of Covid-19 cases in schools.
                <br></br>
                "In a gathering of people, especially in a classroom 
                setting, it is expected that there will be a positive 
                [Covid-19] case, but we want to prevent having a major 
                surge that will exhaust the critical care system here 
                in the Philippines," Education spokesman Michael Poa said 
                in a press briefing Sunday.

                Millions of students wearing face masks streamed back 
                to primary and secondary schools across the Philippines 
                on Monday for their first in-person classes after two 
                years of coronavirus lockdowns that are feared to have 
                worsened alarming illiteracy rates among children.
  
                <br></br>
                Officials grappled with daunting problems, including 
                classroom shortages, lingering COVID-19 fears, an 
                approaching storm and quake-damaged school buildings 
                in the country’s north, to welcome back nearly 28

                A child's first day of school—a landmark moment for 
                the youngest students and their parents around the 
                world—has been delayed due to COVID-19 for an estimated 
                140 million young minds, UNICEF said in a new analysis 
                released as summer break comes to end in many parts of 
                the world. 
  
                <br></br>
                The Philippines is one of the five countries in the 
                world that have not started in-person classes since 
                the pandemic began, affecting the right to learn of 
                more than 27 million Filipino students. While new 
                variants are causing a rise of infections, UNICEF is 
                advocating for a phased reopening of schools, beginning 
                in low-risk areas. This can be done on a voluntary 
                basis with proper safety protocols in place.

                Early childhood education is at crossroads in the 
                country as parents are not keen on enrolling their 
                children in kindergartens. Financial hardship is the 
                main reason for parents not giving much importance to 
                early childhood education.
  
                <br></br>
                According to a report released by the Government, 
                financial struggles, lack of awareness among the 
                parents and lack of facilities in rural areas have 
                affected early childhood education during 2020-2021.

                The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) has 
                revealed alarming new findings about learning loss 
                experienced by Cambodian students during the pandemic. 
                The results emerged from MoEYS' latest National Grade 6 
                Learning Assessment, which was conducted in November 
                2021 and announced in March 2022 after detailed 
                analysis. 
  
                <br></br>
                The Ministry's Education Quality Assurance Department 
                (EQAD) assessed more than 6,000 students in 230 schools 
                across Cambodia and found that children had fallen 
                behind in their learning during the pandemic. Compared 
                to the last equivalent Learning Assessment in 2016, 
                the percentage of students who failed to demonstrate 
                basic proficiency increased from 34% to 45% in the 
                Khmer language and from 49% to 74% in Mathematics.

                Today, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
                (ASEAN) Secretariat and Cambridge Partnership for 
                Education (Cambridge) reveal nine recommendations to 
                tackle the biggest problems in education in Southeast 
                Asia.  The Cambridge-ASEAN policy brief is being 
                launched at an event hosted by British Expertise 
                International in partnership with the Ministry of 
                Education and Training Viet Nam, represented by the 
                Viet Nam Embassy in London.
  
                <br></br>
                In 2021, ASEAN reported that Covid-related school 
                closures affected the quality of education for more 
                than 152 million children across its member states. 
                Separately, public opinion poll specialists Gallup 
                estimated education satisfaction in Southeast Asia 
                fell from 85% to 63% in the first year of the pandemic 
                – the largest drop of a region worldwide. Southeast 
                Asia had been on top for education satisfaction.

                Education is a key pillar of inclusive economic and 
                social development, but as times change, education 
                needs to improve and eradicate the gaps and 
                inequalities within the sector. The future of education 
                is being transformed by technological progress, and the 
                skills used in the workforce are being updated. 
                Consequently, to ensure inclusion and equity within 
                education, certain changes need to be made to the 
                curriculum, as well as establishing a foundation to 
                adapt and develop new skills.

                ‘Close open, close open,’ goes a lesson on the first 
                day at kindergarten as the barely six-year-old child
